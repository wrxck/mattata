# mattata

mattata is a powerful, plugin-based Telegram bot similar to [topkecleon's](https://github.com/topkecleon/otouto). mattata boasts many nifty features such as a fully-fledged administration plugin, AI (native Cleverbot implementation, which utilises my [mattata-ai](https://github.com/wrxck/mattata-ai) library) and much more.

## Setup

Installing & configuring mattata is very simple.

Clone the repository using:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/wrxck/mattata
```

in Terminal. Then, run the following:

```Bash
cd mattata/
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
chmod +x ./launch.sh
```

You'll need sudo access to be able to install the dependencies required. Then, you need to fill in the values in `configuration.lua`. After you've done that, use:

```Bash
./launch.sh
```

to run your bot.

Arguments enclosed in [square brackets] are optional, and arguments enclosed in are required.

You will notice there is a "Flag" column. This is a number which indicated what rights the user must have in order to use the corresponding command(s). Below is a table which explains what each number means:

| Flag | Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User          | All users are in this flag by default. It simply means they exist. This is the lowest flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2    | Moderator     | This flag contains all people of the moderator rank and higher. Moderators are non-official admins who have access to administrative commands, such as /ban, /kick and /unban. Moderators are granted this rank when an administrator replies to their message with /mod or /promote.             |
| 3    | Administrator | This flag contains all of the official group administrators. These are all of the people who have been promoted to an administrator by the creator of the group/channel. These people will have a star displayed next to their name in the member list on your client.                            |
| 4    | Owner         | This is a small category containing only the users who are in the `admins` array of the configuration.lua file. This rank means that the user has access to owner commands such as /bash and /lua, and can control the bot using /reload. This is the highest flag.                               |

All permissions levels are hereditary - meaning a user in flag 3 is also in flags 1 & 2.
